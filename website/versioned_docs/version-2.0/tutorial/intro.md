# Tutorial Intro

This section assumes you have installed StateJet and React. See the **[Getting Started](/docs/category/getting-started)** page for how to get started with StateJet and React from scratch.

- Add todo items
- Edit todo items
- Delete todo items
- Filter todo items
- Display useful stats
