# Tutorial Intro

This section assumes you have installed StateJet and React. See the **[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/prerequisites/)** page for how to get started with StateJet and React from scratch. By the time you finish, you should be able to start building your own StateJet applications.

In Part 1 of this tutorial, we’ll explore the essential concepts and terminology required to work with `useGlobalState()`—ideal for simple applications with minimal state management needs.

In Part 2, we’ll dive into advanced state management using `useSlice()` and `useStore()`, which are better suited for larger applications with more complex and structured state requirements.
