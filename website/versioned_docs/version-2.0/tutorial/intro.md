# Tutorial Intro

This section assumes you have installed StateJet and React. See the **[Getting Started](/docs/category/getting-started)** page for how to get started with StateJet and React from scratch. By the time you finish, you should be able to start building your own StateJet applications.

In Part 1 of this tutorial, we'll cover the key concepts and terms you need to know to use `useGlobalState()`, and in Part 2: Advanced state management concepts using `useSlice()` and `useStore()`.
