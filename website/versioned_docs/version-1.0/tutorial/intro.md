# Tutorial Intro

This section assumes you have installed StateJet and React. See the **[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/prerequisites/)** page for how to get started with StateJet and React from scratch.

In this tutorial, we'll be building a simple **todo-list** application. Our app will be able to do the following:

- Add todo items
- Edit todo items
- Delete todo items
- Filter todo items
- Display useful stats
